## Brandon Corn Midterm

This project makes use of Nodejs and dependencies to showcase comics. There are two pages, one that shows the comic of the day and information regarding that comic and a second page that shows a random comic which can be changed dynamically. 

To get started with this website all you need to do is *npm install* after forking the project. 

An example of the project can be found at https://salty-everglades-74487.herokuapp.com/
